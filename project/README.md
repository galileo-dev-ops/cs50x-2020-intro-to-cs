The Math Formulae Finder is the unique Python aid for students. It helps to memorize formulae used for GCSE/A-Level.

It is programmed in Python, using tkinter to initialize the GUI.

--------------------FIRST-TIME SETUP--------------------

To setup for the first time, you will need:

- An IDE, preferably VS Code or PyCharm, as they are both easy to use.
- A Windows/Mac/Linux machine, or Chromebook
- The program folder, saved to Desktop preferably. If you save it in a different location, note the location of it.

    - If saved to Desktop:
    
   Windows: C:\Users\{user}\Desktop               (Use correct path as to where it is saved)
   Mac: /Users/{user}/Desktop
   Linux: /home/{user}/Desktop
   Chromebook: /home/{user}
   
   
 TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
 
 At the start of the program, you will find all variables that need a defined path.
 Replace the dummy path (/Volumes/Samsung T5/Math Formulae Finder) with the path of the program folder, e.g:
 /Users/{user}/Desktop/Math-Formulae-Finder-master
 
 The program is quite self-explanatory. Please report any bugs on GitHub!
